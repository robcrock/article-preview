## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### What I learned

I am sure I could've have come up with a more elegant solution to the responsive footer. I was a challenge to have such different components appear in the different devices, but that was where the challenge in the exercise lied. I feel like the Next Image docs could be better, but thankfully MDN was there to fill in the gaps.

### Continued development

I want to move onto the next challenge, but I'll continue to work on improving my process. It's coming along well and these repetitions really help!
